<!-- There are 2 methods for writing hidden comments in MD (Markdown) Files i.e., using the following syntax = "(e.g., [comment]: # )" OR using a HTML Comment Tag instead --> 

<!-- NOTE BENNE!!! > It is important to note that some Markdown Engines will leave in HTML when rendering the Markdown File, so be careful what you put inside of comments! -->

<!--
I can also do a multi-line comment like this
-->

<!-- [comment]: # (Another way to add a secret comment, that will be completely omitted by almost ALL Markdown renderers, is to use an empty Link Definition. As it is unused, as long as it is wrapped in parentheses, it won't be rendered!) -->

<!-- A shortcut to generate HTML comment tags = "CTRL + /" -->

<!-- I really like all of these font's:
- Cairo
- DM Sans
- Kanit
- Oswald
- Outfit
- Prompt
- Quicksand
- Raleway
So maybe use these for future projects...

# **A dossier on the chosen one** 📓

My name is neomeiji ⚗️🧙🏽‍♂️ ```(Barak)``` and I'm a high-ranking Grand Wizard 📜✨ ```(Associate Consultant)```, who currently casts spells 🪄 ```(works)``` at **[Version 1](https://www.version1.com/)**

I advocate for the following > **#buildinginpublic #foss #emulation #freedomofknowledge #kaizen #wizardsrule #dumbledoresucks #merlinisoverrated #imthebestmage #alchemyforall**

My direct focus is on being the best Software Engineer I can be, as I have been trying to break into ~~alchemy~~ tech for over 2 1/2 years now!

I have certifications across AWS, The Linux Foundation and Cisco amongst others, however theory is *useless* without **practice**🤺🎯

Project-based learning leads to ascension from the fiery pits of tutorial hell; so keep building, my friend 🛐

# **What am I developing right now, in the ether?** 🧪

I'm currently in the process of building a Discord Bot 🤖 in C# (they are commonly built using Python), that leverages Azure OpenAI APIs, Azure AI Search and potentially web scraping; in order to retrieve panels from any manga or comic that the user requests 💻

I aim to incorporate ```OOP Principles (the 4 pillars) 🏛️``` within this project and any future endeavours moving forward 📈

I intend to publish projects to my GitHub and do so more frequently 👨🏽‍💻

I also want to compartmentalize my ```custom-built``` personal website into microservices, and then get it deployed 🌐

# **That's cool and all, but does the wizard have any hobbies or interests?**

**Yes yes I'm getting to that, be *patient* young mage...**

When I'm not coding or fighting Saruman, I'm an enjoyer of the following:

* Microcontrollers like the ```M5StickC Plus 2``` and exploring cool devices like a ```Cyberdeck/RP5/CYD/ESP32/Ghost Laptop + LoRa Technology 📡```

* Science Fiction Literature:
```Asimov | Clarke | Dick 📚```

* Transhumanism > It both terrifies and excites me 

* Manga / Comics - I have a decent sized collection (not just Marvel and DC)

* Fragrances - A wizard cannot leave the shadow realm without a spritz 

* Watches > I love horology and this quote - "A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives **precisely** when he means to." ⌚

* Motorbikes > Currently riding a ```2021 Honda CB125F```, next bike to buy are any of these: ```Suzuki SV650S, Suzuki SV1000, Honda VFR800, Honda CBR650RR, Kawasaki ZX9R, Yamaha R6 or a Yamaha R1 🏍️```

* Films > I'm an avid film watcher and have seen all sorts, *however*, my list is longer than the spells I know...

* Graphic Design > I *love* clean UI/UX and I'm rusty as ever, but everything you see here is custom baby, WOOHOO!!!
